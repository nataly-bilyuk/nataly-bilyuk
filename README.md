## Hi there 👋

I am a hard-working and adaptable professional with a passion for data analysis. As a former foreign 
languages and communication trainer with over 10 years of experience in corporate training, academic 
instruction, and technical communication who wanted to change careers, I upskilled my data analysis 
knowledge in exploring data, data analytics software and processes in the Generation programme. My 
previous roles mean I have excellent communication, analytical and problem solving skills as well as being a 
quick learner. I am a result-oriented, self-motivated  emerging data analyst looking forward to applying my 
knowledge and skills to contribute to the team, bring value to the company and develop my career.

I’m curious about data and technology, both learning how to apply the new developments in everyday life and 
work situations, as well as researching the impact they have in short and long-term perspective. I’m 
passionate about languages and linguistics, which enhance my communication skills, cultural awareness, and 
analytical thinking—especially when exploring the structure and logic behind different language systems and 
interpreting data about languages and how they develop to solve problems. I enjoy travelling, which sharpens 
my research, planning, and adaptability through real-world problem-solving. Reading widely, from thrillers to 
books on history and psychology, fuels my curiosity and continuous learning mindset. I also enjoy cycling and 
dancing, which support my focus, discipline, and collaborative spirit.
